AGENT: Good morning! Thank you for calling Sunrise Family Care. This is Lisa speaking. May I have your full name to get started?

PATIENT: Hi Lisa, my name is James Turner.

AGENT: Thanks, James. Can you spell your last name for me, please?

PATIENT: Sure, it’s T-U-R-N-E-R.

AGENT: Got it, thank you. And what's the best phone number we can use to reach you?

PATIENT: You can reach me at 444-321-7788.

AGENT: Alright, 444-321-7788. So, what can we help you with today?

PATIENT: I've been having some trouble with my lower back. It's been sore and kind of stiff for about a week and a half now.

AGENT: Okay, lower back soreness and stiffness. Have you noticed any other symptoms? Like numbness, tingling, or pain shooting down your leg?

PATIENT: Yeah, actually—sometimes there's a dull ache that goes into my right leg, especially if I’ve been sitting too long.

AGENT: That sounds uncomfortable. And you said it started about a week and a half ago?

PATIENT: Yeah, right around then.

AGENT: Has it been constant or does it come and go?

PATIENT: Mostly constant, but worse at the end of the day.

AGENT: Alright. Do you recall if this started after any injury—maybe lifting something, sports, or even a long drive?

PATIENT: I think it started after I helped a friend move some furniture, but I’m not totally sure.

AGENT: Got it. And have you seen anyone else for this issue yet?

PATIENT: No, you guys are the first I’ve contacted.

AGENT: Okay, let’s take a look at your insurance. Do you have coverage you’d like to use?

PATIENT: Yes, I’m with Blue Cross Blue Shield.

AGENT: Great, Blue Cross. Can you read me the Member ID number from your card?

PATIENT: It’s BC987654321.

AGENT: Thank you. And do you happen to have a group number listed?

PATIENT: Yeah, it says GRP-789T.

AGENT: Perfect. And are you the primary policyholder?

PATIENT: Yes, I am.

AGENT: Do you carry any secondary insurance?

PATIENT: No, just the Blue Cross.

AGENT: Alright, thanks for confirming that. Let me check what’s available... Looks like we can get you in with Dr. Patel this Thursday at 2:15 PM. Does that work?

PATIENT: Thursday at 2:15 works for me.

AGENT: Excellent. So you're all set—Thursday at 2:15 PM with Dr. Patel at our Westview location on 132 Wellness Blvd. We'll send you a confirmation text along with a link to fill out your intake forms online. Please try to complete that before your appointment.

PATIENT: Will do, thank you.

AGENT: You're welcome! Do you have any questions before we wrap up?

PATIENT: Nope, I’m good.

AGENT: Alright then, James. We’ll see you Thursday. Take care and have a great day!

PATIENT: Thanks, you too!
