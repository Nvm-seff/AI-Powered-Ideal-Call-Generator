AGENT: Hello, thank you for calling Healthy Clinic, my name is Ben. May I start with your full name, please?
PATIENT: Hi Ben, it's Sarah Miller.
AGENT: Okay Sarah, thanks. Could you spell your last name for me?
PATIENT: Sure, M-I-L-L-E-R.
AGENT: Got it. And what's the best phone number to reach you?
PATIENT: 555-987-6543.
AGENT: Okay, 555-987-6543. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: My left shoulder has been really stiff and painful for about two weeks.
AGENT: Your left shoulder, okay. Besides stiff and painful, are there any other symptoms like clicking, grinding, or weakness?
PATIENT: It's mainly the stiffness, and I definitely feel weaker when I try to lift things overhead.
AGENT: And this started about two weeks ago? Has it been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's been pretty constant since it started.
AGENT: Alright. Is this related to any specific injury, like a fall, car accident, or anything at work?
PATIENT: No, not that I can think of. It just kind of started.
AGENT: Have you had any prior treatment or seen any other doctors for this specific shoulder issue before?
PATIENT: No, this is the first time.
AGENT: Okay. Let's look at insurance. Do you have health insurance you'd like to use?
PATIENT: Yes, I have Aetna.
AGENT: Okay, Aetna. Could I get the Member ID number from your card?
PATIENT: It's W123456789.
AGENT: W123456789. Is there a group number as well?
PATIENT: Yes, GRP-ABC.
AGENT: And are you the subscriber, the main person on the policy?
PATIENT: Yes.
AGENT: Do you have any secondary insurance coverage?
PATIENT: No, just the Aetna.
AGENT: Okay, thanks for that information. Let me check the schedule... It looks like Dr. Davis has an opening this Friday at 10:30 AM. Would that time work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Friday at 10:30 is perfect.
AGENT: Great. So that's booked. Friday at 10:30 AM with Dr. Davis at our main clinic on 456 Health Drive. We'll send you a text message with a link to our online new patient portal to complete your paperwork beforehand. Please try to do that at least a day before your visit.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good.
AGENT: Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No, thank you.
AGENT: Alright then, Sarah. We look forward to seeing you on Friday. Have a good day!
PATIENT: Thanks, you too. Bye.
