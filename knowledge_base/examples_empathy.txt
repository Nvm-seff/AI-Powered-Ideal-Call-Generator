Best Practice: Actively listen and acknowledge the patient's situation, pain, or frustration to build rapport and show you care. Use validating and supportive language.

Example Empathetic Phrases:
- When patient describes pain/discomfort:
    - 'I'm really sorry to hear you're experiencing that pain in your [body part]. That sounds very uncomfortable.'
    - 'I understand that must be difficult to deal with.'
    - 'Thank you for explaining that. Let's see what we can do to help.'
- When patient expresses frustration (e.g., with previous treatment, waiting):
    - 'I can understand why you would feel frustrated in that situation.'
    - 'That sounds like a challenging experience.'
    - 'Let's work together to find a solution/get you the help you need.'
- General Acknowledgement:
    - 'Okay, I understand.' (Use sincerely, not dismissively)
    - 'Thank you for sharing that with me.'
