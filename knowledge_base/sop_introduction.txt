Best Practice: Start calls professionally and clearly state your name and the clinic's name. Aim to immediately engage the patient politely.

Example Script Opening:
'Thank you for calling CareCloud MTBC , my name is [Agent Name]. To help you best today, could I please start with your full name?'

Key elements:
- Greeting (Thank you for calling...)
- Clinic Name
- Agent Name
- Polite request for patient identification (e.g., name)
