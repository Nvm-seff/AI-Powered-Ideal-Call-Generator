Best Practice: If the patient indicates the reason for their call might be related to a Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) or Workers Compensation (W/C), systematically gather specific details required for these case types.

MVA/WC Initial Question:
- 'Is this condition or injury related to an accident, either a car accident (MVA) or an incident at work (Workers Comp)?'

If YES to MVA:
- Date of the accident?
- State where the accident occurred?
- What was your role (e.g., driver, passenger, pedestrian)?
- Were airbags deployed? Was a seatbelt worn?
- Were you taken by ambulance or other transport to a healthcare facility?
    - If yes, which facility?
- Do you have auto insurance claim information? (Insurer, Claim #, Adjuster Name/Contact #)
- Are you currently working with an attorney regarding the accident? (If yes, get Attorney Name/Contact #)

If YES to W/C:
- Date of the work injury?
- Employer at the time of injury?
- Do you have Workers Compensation claim information? (Insurer, Claim #, Adjuster Name/Contact #)
- Are you working with an attorney? (If yes, get Attorney Name/Contact #)
