 Hello, thank you for calling Care Cloud MTBC. My name is Ben. May I start by confirming your full name, please? Hi Ben, it's Sarah Miller. Thank you Sarah Miller. Could you please spell your last name for me to ensure I have it correct? Sure, M-I-L-L-L-E-R. Perfect, thank you. And could you verify the best phone number to reach you at? 555-987-6543. Thank you Sarah. I've noted your phone number as 555-987-6-443. To help me access your records efficiently, could you please tell me what brings you in today? My left shoulder has been really stiff and painful for about two weeks. I'm sorry to hear your experiencing shoulder pain, Sarah. Could you describe the pain and stiffness for me? Are there any other symptoms such as clicking, grinding, or weakness? It's mainly the stiffness, and I definitely feel weaker when I try to lift things overhead. I understand. This has been ongoing for about two weeks and it's fairly constant. Yes, pretty constant since it started. Has this been related to any specific injury, like a fall, a car accident, or anything at work? No, not that I can think of. It just kind of started. Okay. To ensure we provide the best care, have you had any prior treatment for this shoulder issue, or seen any other doctors? If so, could you please provide their names and contact information? Also, could you tell me about any previous diagnostic testing, such as X-rays or MRIs related to your shoulder? It would be helpful if you could bring any records from previous treatments to your appointment. No, this is the first time. Thank you for that information, Sarah. Now, to proceed with scheduling your appointment, could you please provide your Etna insurance information? I'll need your member ID number and group number. Yes, I have Etna. It's W-1-2-3-4-5-7-A. Thank you. And the group number? G-R-P-U-B-S. Thank you. Are you the subscriber on the policy? Yes. Great. Do you have any secondary insurance coverage? No, just the Etna. Perfect. Let me check the schedule. Looks like Dr. Davis has an opening this Friday at 10.30 a.m. Before I book this for you, Sarah, could you confirm that Friday at 10.30 a.m. works for you? The appointment is at our main clinic on 456 health drive. We'll send you a text message with a link to our online new patient portal to complete your paperwork beforehand. Please try to do that at least a day before your visit. Yes, Friday at 10.30 is perfect. Excellent, Sarah. I've booked your appointment with Dr. Davis for Friday at 10.30 a.m. at 456 health drive. We'll send you that text message shortly with a link to the online portal. Do you have any other questions for me today? No, thank you. You're very welcome, Sarah.
