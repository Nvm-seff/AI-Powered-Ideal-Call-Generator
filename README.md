# Audio Transcription and AI Response Project

This project connects an OpenAI model to process transcribed audio (simulated text for now) and generate AI responses. The project is structured for secure API key handling using environment variables and is designed to expand later into real-time audio transcription and keyword/question detection.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Secure integration with OpenAI API.
- Modular code structure for easy expansion.
- Supports keyword detection and response logic (coming soon).
- Designed for both local testing and production environments.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
your-project/
├── main.py                # Main script to handle input and response
├── .env                   # Stores sensitive environment variables (DO NOT COMMIT)
├── .gitignore             # Git ignore rules
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## 🔒 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

This file should never be committed to GitHub. Make sure your `.gitignore` includes:

```
.env
```

---

## 💻 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file and insert your OpenAI API Key:

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > .env
```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script simulates an audio transcription input, sends it to the OpenAI API, and prints the AI's response.

---

## 💡 Future Scope

- Replace simulated text input with real-time audio-to-text transcription using OpenAI's `whisper` or Google Speech-to-Text.
- Implement keyword and question detection.
- Add logging, error handling, and unit tests.
- Optional: Containerize with Docker for deployment.

## 🛡️ Security Note

This project uses a `.env` file for sensitive credentials.
**Never hardcode API keys or commit `.env` to your repository.**
